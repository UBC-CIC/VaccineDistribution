# Vaccine Distribution

## Project Overview
This prototype intents to address vaccine distribution supply-chain challenges. It allows distributors to take action if a vaccine batch begins to exceed its temperature requirement during transportation, by leverating IoT sensor in the container that measures temperature, humidity and give the ability to track the location of vaccine batches in near-real time. The solution also implementes a blockchain smart-contract based on AWS Quantum Ledger Database.

### Further Recommendations 
This is a proof of concept done by UBC CIC in collaboration with AWS. The algorithm can be improved by modifying weights and adding more words to conjunctions and spellchecker. Furthermore, one can also begin to consider the impact of other metadata that is already being recorded such as height, weight and age for scheduling an MRI scan.
