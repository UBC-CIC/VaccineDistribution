# Vaccine Distribution

## Project Overview
This prototype intents to address vaccine distribution supply-chain challenges. It allows distributors to take action if a vaccine batch begins to exceed its temperature requirement during transportation, by leverating IoT sensor in the container that measures temperature, humidity and give the ability to track the location of vaccine batches in near-real time. The solution also implementes a blockchain smart-contract based on AWS Quantum Ledger Database.
