# Vaccine Distribution

## Project Overview
This prototype aims to address supply-chain challenges in vaccine distribution. An IoT sensor in each container allows the distributor to monitor temperature and humidity during transportation. The sensor also allows distributor to track the location in near-real time. The solution implements a blockchain smart-contract based on AWS Quantum Ledger Database.
